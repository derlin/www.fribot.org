== Description ==
 
Google+ is Google's foray into the world of social media. Over the past six months we've seen it expand rapidly and the WPMU DEV Google+ Plugin has expanded with it.

The WPMU DEV Google+ Plugin lets you add a +1 button to your website so that people can tell the world how awesome they think you are. 
 It integrates with Google+ Posts and Pages so that people can easily add you to their G+ Circles.

And now you can post directly from G+ to your WordPress website. The Google+ plugin supports post formats so you can use a hashtag system to decide which post format you want your G+ post to appear as.
