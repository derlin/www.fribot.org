== Other Notes ==

= Filters =

** Log Output Within the Table **

*sll-output-data* - filters table row array where array keys are column names and values is the output
For example, we can use this filter to link IP addresses to a geo-location service:
`
<?php
add_filter( 'sll-output-data', 'link_location_by_ip' );
function link_location_by_ip($item){

	//$item is a single row for columns with their values

	$item['ip'] = sprintf('<a target="_blank"  href="http://infosniper.net/index.php?ip_address=%1$s&map_source=3&two_maps=1&overview_map=1&lang=1&map_type=1&zoom_level=11">%1$s</a>', $item['ip']);
	return $item;
}
?>

= Translation =

If you would like to contribute, the POT file is available in the *languages* folder. Translation file name convention is *sll-{locale}.mo*, where {locale} is the locale of your language. Fore example, Russian file name would be *sll-ru_RU.po*.
