# [Shoestrap](http://shoestrap.org) WordPress theme!

Shoestrap started as a fork of the amazing [Roots](http://roots.io) theme.
We added lots of hooks, actions, rewrote various parts of the theme and made it completely extensible.
Using the included admin options developers and site owners can create and prototype sites without any coding and with just a few clicks.

## Options Panel

Please install the [ReduxFramework](http://reduxframework.com) plugin to use all the options of this theme.

## Automated Compiling
